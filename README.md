# Ngram Builder

You'll find this library handy if you're interested in extracting
[n-grams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) from chunks of text.

## Installation

    $ python setup.py install

## Usage

These code snippets should give you an idea of what you can do with it:

    >>> counter = ngb.Counter()
    >>> builder = ngb.NgramBuilder()
    >>> text = "One response to this kind of shortcoming is to abandon the simple or strict n-gram model and introduce features from traditional linguistic theory, such as hand-crafted state variables that represent, for instance, the position in a sentence, the general topic of discourse or a grammatical state variable. Some of the best parsers of English currently in existence are roughly of this form."
    >>>
    >>> for i in range(1, 4):
    ...     counter.add(builder.find_ngrams(text, i))
    ... 

At this point we have a dictionary containing n-grams of one, two or three words in length mapped to the number of times that each n-gram occurred. 

Because the corpus of text was so small it's quite likely that most n-grams will only occur once, but let's see what else we've got:

    >>> for ngram, count in counter.iteritems():
    ...     if count > 1:
    ...         print ngram, count
    ... 
    to 2
    the 4
    state 2
    of 5
    or 2
    this 2
    in 2

If you're using this library seriously you should experiment with
`ngb.Counter.remove_subphrases` -- it can come in very handy. It removes
n-grams that are part of a longer n-gram if the shorter n-gram appears just as
frequently as the longer n-gram (which means that it can only be present
within the longer n-gram).

In this example, it removes the majority of our n-grams.

    >>> len(counter)
    165
    >>> counter.remove_subphrases()
    >>> len(counter)
    65

Finally, if you're not interested in stop words, we can really reduce the set further by passing a set of words that are to be ignored to the builder:

    >>> builder = ngb.NgramBuilder(ngb.stopwords)
    >>> counter = ngb.Counter()
    >>> for i in range(1, 4):
    ...     counter.add(builder.find_ngrams(text, i))
    ... 
    >>> counter.remove_subphrases()
    >>> len(counter)
    29
    >>> ngrams = counter.keys()
    >>> ngrams.sort()
    >>> for ngram in ngrams:
    ...     print ngram
    ...
